Please read the following instructions before starting.

The main Html files are located in the public folder
The admin side store html files are stored in public/admin/..
The db connection file, all the function files and backend files are stored in resources/..

We tried to make this as neat as possible so that it looks professional. 
All images are stored in resources/uploads as they are uploaded to the website.

For the sql database, we have downloaded the db that we made via localhost/phpmyadmin/ 
So to connect the website with the db data, create a database named ecom_db and then select the 
import button and import the ecom_db.sql file that we attached. All tables should be copied.

We used the root user with no password and the localhost server so that everyone can access it 
easily. 
We also made a github reporsitory in case you wanted to download all the files or share them later.
